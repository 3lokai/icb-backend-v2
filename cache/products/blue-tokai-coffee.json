    "description": "This special two-pack( 125 gms each) , crafted in partnership with Kerehaklu Estate, features our favourite mutation, a Peaberry. Coffee cherries usually hold two seeds but about 5-10% of the time, just one seed grows inside the cherry. This is a Peaberry. Small, round, and denser than regular coffee beans, it boasts a unique flavour profile, with a deeper sweetness and a brighter acidity. Carefully isolated by Pranoy, Ajoy, and team at the farm, the Peaberries that lent to the creation of this pack were processed in two distinct ways: - Washed (Aerobic Sequential) This lot underwent a sequential aerobic fermentation, where Peaberries were submerged in water for an extended period, creating an oxygen-rich environment that brought out complexity, clarity, and bright acidity. Roasted light, these make for a cup with the aroma of brown sugar and citrus, and a juicy mouthfeel that opens into notes of mosambi, toffee, and green grape. The aftertaste is sweet and reminds of ripe mosambis. Natural (Anoxic) Fermented in an oxygen-free environment, the coffee cherries in this lot experienced a slower, more complex fermentation, since the microbes had more time to break down the sugars present, and produce a wider range of aromatic compounds. The result is a rich, fruity flavour profile with a deep body and balance. Roasted light, these make for a cup with the aroma of red grape and dark cherries, and a creamy mouthfeel revealing notes of orange, red grape, and red apple. Punctuating each sip is a lingering aftertaste of red apple. We recommend brewing these coffees black as a Pour Over or using an AeroPress. Recommended Resting Period: 15 Days Note: This coffee pack is a special release with limited availability and, therefore, cannot be included in our Mixed Bag subscription.",

    "description": "A melting pot of micro-climates where some of India’s finest coffee has thrived since 1920, MSP Coffee is a group of seven estates in Yercaud, including the three that lend to this blend. From achieving a surprisingly sweet cup after fermenting coffee with a local variety of bitter lemons to seeing the tail end of a 1000-hour ferment, the group exemplifies how curiosity lies at the heart of their work. The micro lots we picked for this blend come from Bison Valley Estate, Stanmore Estate, and Orchardale Estate and bear this very spirit. The first lot was washed and fermented with melon extract, with the processing imparting a unique sweetness. The second underwent triple fermentation: first as whole cherries, then after depulping, and finally after washing. This process uniquely combined quick dry fermentation and long anaerobic fermentation with watermelon, developing complexity. The third coffee was processed using the natural method, with cherries dried intact, allowing the fruit to shape its character. Roasted medium, the blend has a fruity and punchy flavour profile with notes of cherry, dark chocolate, and wild berry, followed by a rich, lingering aftertaste of chocolate. This blend works well black as well as with milk and lends itself nicely to most brewing methods including espresso, Pour Over, Moka Pot, French Press, AeroPress, and Cold Brew. Recommended Resting Period: 7 Days",

    "description": "Fermented with rose petals, this layered light roast perfectly embodies why Riverdale Estate is a pioneer in experimental processing. Only the ripest cherries, hand-picked from the higher-altitude blocks of the farm, where the fruit matures slowly and develops an enhanced sweetness, were used. Once harvested, the cherries underwent a triple wash with natural spring water to remove impurities, followed by a floating process to eliminate underdeveloped beans. During fermentation, rose petals were introduced, setting up the stage for complexity in the cup. After fermentation, the cherries were slow-dried on raised beds for up to 30 days, allowing for even drying. Finally, the coffee was hulled at the estate’s dry mill, where any defective beans were eliminated before being sent to our roastery. In the cup, you’ll experience bright notes of blood orange, passion fruit, and pomegranate, complemented by a creamy mouthfeel and a lingering sweetness. We recommend brewing it black using an AeroPress or as a Pour Over.

    "description": "We’re excited to bring back Nano-X, our series of experiments created by a handful of visionary producers and creative Blue Tokai roasters, with the prized Gesha from Riverdale Estate. The Gesha variety is considered among the most sought-after, most expensive, and highest-scoring coffees which tend to score 90 points and above, in any part of the world. It originally hails from Ethiopia’s Gori Gesha Forest and was responsible for completely changing the world’s coffee landscape. Geshas are very hard to come across, and since last year, Prakashan and his team have been among the few ensuring a homegrown Gesha flourishes at Riverdale Estate. The coffee cherries he and his team harvested this year were processed by performing carbonic maceration in barrels, an experimental processing technique in which ripe coffee cherries are fermented in a CO2-rich, anaerobic environment. Roasted light, the result is an exceptional lot, with the pleasant aroma of jasmine and oranges, and a multitude of delicate floral and fruity notes that evolve as the brew cools. Tasting Notes: Cantaloupe, Pomegranate, Bergamot, Jasmine Roast Level: Light About the Farm and Producer Nestled in the Shevaroy Hills of Tamil Nadu, Riverdale Estate has been managed by three generations since 1920. Its producer, Prakashan Balaraman, is one of the front-runners for experimental processing in India and he believes that the secret to good coffee begins with the crop. He’s been challenging traditional growing and processing practices and has previously processed coffees for us where interesting elements like papaya, pineapple and champagne yeast were used. About the Roaster Our roasting team was very excited to work with a Gesha for the 2nd year, and one of our seasoned roasters, Shreyas, fine-tuned its roast profile. He appreciates how it makes for a clean, complex cup with a bouquet of delicate fruity notes, with floral notes standing out. Please Note: This is a special release available in limited quantities. Due to the exclusive nature of this coffee, no replacements or refunds will be offered. Every batch has been carefully cupped and approved by our expert roasters to ensure the highest quality. We recommend enjoying this coffee between 20 and 30 days post-roast, ideally after two weeks, for the best flavor experience.",
