Long back when India was exporting coffees to Europe on ships, while crossing the cape of good hope the coffee was exposed to sea winds and rains, Due to the exposure, the coffee ripened from fresh green to a more aged pale yellow. The nature played its trick and the old pale looking bean gave rise to a new interesting cup quality to be enjoyed for centuries. It is today that we intentionally monsoon the coffee. We are proud to present to you one of the top grades of monsoon Malabar, Plantation A, a specialty coffee of India. Enjoy every cup till the last slurp!
