Perfect! Let's plan this systematically. Looking at your file structure, here's the **optimal order** to run ruff and fix issues:

## ðŸŽ¯ Ruff Analysis Order (Bottom-Up Dependency Chain)

### Phase 1: Foundation Files (No dependencies)
```bash
ruff check config.py
ruff check common/utils.py  
[x] ruff check db/models.py 
```

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Depends on Phase 1)
```bash
ruff check common/platform_detector.py
ruff check common/cache.py
ruff check common/enricher.py
ruff check db/supabase.py
```

### Phase 3: Extractors & Validators (Depends on Phase 1-2)
```bash
ruff check scrapers/product/extractors/validators.py
ruff check scrapers/product/extractors/attributes.py
ruff check scrapers/product/extractors/normalizers.py
ruff check scrapers/product/extractors/price.py
ruff check scrapers/product/enrichment/deepseek.py
```

### Phase 4: Platform-Specific Scrapers (Depends on Phase 1-3)
```bash
ruff check scrapers/product/shopify.py
ruff check scrapers/product/woocommerce.py  
ruff check scrapers/product/static.py
ruff check scrapers/product/scraper.py
ruff check scrapers/roaster/scraper.py
```

### Phase 5: Main Applications (Depends on everything)
```bash
ruff check run_roaster.py
ruff check run_product_scraper.py
ruff check main.py
```

## ðŸš€ Let's Start!

**Run this command first:**
```bash
ruff check config.py common/utils.py db/models.py
```
